# Lick_o_Meter
This is custom MATLAB software that was built for auditory perception experiments. This software interacts with hardware (lights, air puff, juice dispenser, IR beam) to interactively train animals by reinforcement and punishment. Subject behavior is monitored by the software. Please see the LickometerManual_121912.pdf for details on what the software can do and how it interacts with hardware.
